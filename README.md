# Decision Tree Classification â€“ Data Mining Project

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a decision tree classifier using Python and scikit-learn. It includes all necessary steps from data loading and preprocessing to model visualization and export.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- `Decision Tree.ipynb` â€“ Main Jupyter Notebook performing classification, evaluation, and visualization.
- `D3.csv` â€“ Input dataset.
- `dm_tools.py` â€“ Python module containing helper functions used in the notebook.
- `DT.pickle` â€“ Serialized trained decision tree model (via `pickle`).
- `dt_viz.png` â€“ Visualization of the initial decision tree.
- `optimal_tree.png` â€“ Visualization of the pruned or optimal decision tree.
- `requirements.txt` â€“ List of Python dependencies.
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation (this file).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Load and preprocess structured data
- Train a decision tree model on the data
- Evaluate performance using classification metrics
- Visualize the decision tree structure using `pydot` and export graphics
- Save and reuse models with `pickle`
- Separate reusable functions into an external script (`dm_tools.py`)
